    <h1>Covid 19</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Coronavirus disease 2019</strong> (<strong>COVID-19</strong>),
      also known as <strong>the coronavirus</strong> or <strong>COVID</strong>,
      is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan,
      China, in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading
      to an ongoing pandemic.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Transmission of COVID-19 occurs mainly when an infected person is in
        close contact with another person</em>. Small droplets containing the virus can spread from an infected
      person's nose and mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak.
      Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or
      eyes. Airborne transmission is also sometimes possible, as smaller
      infected droplets and particles can linger in the air for minutes to hours
      within enclosed spaces that have inadequate ventilation. Less commonly,
      the virus may spread via contaminated surfaces. People who are infected
      can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they
      themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.
      People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in
      moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.

    <h2>Signs and symptoms </h2>

    <p></p>
    Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild
    symptoms to severe illness. Common symptoms include : Headache, Loss of
    smell and taste, Nasal congestion and runny nose, Cough, Muscle pain, Sore
    throat, Fever, Diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. People with the same
    infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over
    time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one
    respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and
    fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain,
    headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain,
    vomiting, and diarrhea. 
    
    <h2>Prevention</h2> 
    
    <p>
    Preventive measures to reduce the chances
    of infection include staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding
    crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces,
    managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water
    (H<sub>2</sub>O) often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory
    hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.

    <h2>What People think of Covid</h2> 
  
    <p>
    Here is a quote from Professor Karen Willis, a health sociologist in the School of Allied Health: 
    
    <blockquote>
    “Some people are very
    optimistic about their low likelihood of contracting the virus. Others are
    overly pessimistic and think they are more at risk than they are. We will be
    examining these perspectives to understand how people think about risk, and
    how that shapes community response to government directives such as lockdown
    or social distancing ”
